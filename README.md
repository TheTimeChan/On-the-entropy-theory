# Evolutionary Entropy Theory

This repository contains original mathematical research developed by **Jayant Sharma**, in mathematics. The theory introduces a novel mathematical framework centered around:

- **Evolution**: Describing structured changes from one state to another.
- **Transform**: The rules guiding how an initial block evolves.
- **Framework**: A defined set of constraints on the allowable transforms (e.g., algebraic-only).
- **Entropy**: A measure of disorder or unpredictability of an evolution within a framework.

## Key Concepts Introduced

- Relative entropy of an evolution with respect to different mathematical frameworks.
- Principles and theorems formalizing how entropy governs transformations.
- Applications to:
  - **Meta/Organic functions** and generalized hypotheses.
  - **P vs NP**, via entropy in restricted computational frameworks.
